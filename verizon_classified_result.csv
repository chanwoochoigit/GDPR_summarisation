6,"Verizon Media EMEA Limited (“Verizon Media”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a media and technology company that runs two different types of businesses:

These brands provide content, commerce and mail services to hundreds of millions of users. We are able to offer you most of our Products for free thanks to our digital advertising services.
",standard_trivial
8,"    Second, we offer digital advertising ‘Services’ that help advertisers reach the users that are likely to be more interested in their products, help us and our publishers generate revenue by selling advertising space on sites and apps to advertisers, and help users see ads that are relevant to their interests. Our Services do this by selecting, placing and measuring relevant ads to users as they visit different sites and apps.
